IE 6600: Computation and Visualization
Hackathon Guidelines
Background:
Data scientists are taking a lead role in applying advanced analytics tools and techniques in ways that can help people in need. The data science field plays an increasingly important role in all aspects of modern life. Like people in other professions, data scientists feel a duty to contribute their skills and knowledge to serve people in their communities and around the world.
Guidelines:
I. The sections to be included:
• Introduction (half page): Provide an overview of the project and the problem statement.
• 2-3 sections: In each section, you focus on a specific topic of your choice and use data-viz to draw conclusions and interpretations. Multiple graphs can be used with each section to unveil different perspectives of your selected topic. For instance, you can select 'education' as a topic and illustrate differences in terms of countries, genders, etc. It is highly recommended to perform cross-tab analysis over different indicators (for example, education vs. economic indicators) to understand how they influence each other.
Please make sure that the graphs embedded in your report are of appropriate size and are labelled correctly.
• Conclusion (half page): List the main takeaways and insights. You can also briefly mention possible future extensions of your work.
